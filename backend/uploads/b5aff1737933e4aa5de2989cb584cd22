*I hope you are all doing great in your life and seek yourself in a new destiny. So this would be a great occasion for all of you who are willing to do projects Minor and Major with the help of our Industrial experts who have experience of 10-15 years in one specific domain.*
*The major thing would be for you that TF IIT Bombay shortlisted your college for the master industrial training classes which are being conducted by TF itself where they will shortlist a few students for the upcoming projects based on your performance so it is a chance I would say for you students to prove your overall skills if you have zero knowledge then you can also utilize this opportunity to become competent and extraordinary regarding your interest.*

24/04/24, 23:53 - +91 70391 07763: My dear B.E. students...

I know you guys are having a countdown in your mind as it was almost your last working day as together, today.

HoD submissions and Project viva done finally!!!

You had your last submission. 

It feels like y'day, when being an exam incharge I used to check on you all while you guys giving your  IA exams. (to your horror,  me on the round... checking your mobile phones and jeans' pockets...)

I assume, by now, you have started to hate me a little less and love me a little more. (See... m pretty much optimistic...)

You vivas have already been  started...
All the best for the same.
Do well all of you.

This time, considering d placement record... few of the students are placed. The other few are applying to colleges abroad... 
Some of you are still fighting with their own thoughts drowning in dual mind...
Still... somehow , all of you have no idea where your life might be heading in this real world.

Responsibilities may suddenly become real, the day you graduate.

On one hand, you can't wait for the college to get over, on the other, you know you're gonna miss it like anything.

You find yourself listening to "यारो दोस्ती बडी ही हसीन है..." , "हम रहे या ना रहे कल, पल याद आयेंगे ये पल..." more often these days.

You know that the life after this will be more unforgiving, more brutal.
" मॅडम, अंबरनाथवरून आलो", असं म्हणून लेटमार्क आता परवडणार नाही... कारण तुमचा पगार कापला जाईल...

" आधीच घरातून लवकर निघता येत नाही का?" असं ओरडूनही पुन्हा "अरे जा रे, बोलव जा त्याला... imp diagram आहे Automata ची" असं म्हणत परत वर्गात घेऊन शिकवणाऱ्या दीपाली मॅडम  आता नसतील...

No matter how much you say you dislike it, but deep down, you know, you will miss this damn place.

The classrooms, the desks, the passage, the refugee area, GITS, 805, Lectures, labs, छापलेल्या assignments... everything...

N trust me guys...

Even the college is gonna miss you... This Deepali ma'am is gonna miss you for sure...

Thanks for all the events you guys organized for us... (GITS... TECHGITS...ECELL... MVM... NSS... actually all of you... who partipated, cheered, volunteered, headed and organized.)

Thanks for always being there on one single phonecall...

Wish you all the very best for your future my children...

May you all get whatever you deserve and a lot lot more than you desire...

Loads of love!❤️
Loads of blessings!!!🙌🏻

Go... and fly in the sky!!!
Universe is calling you with open arms!
Rock the world.

Take care.
Stay safe.
Stay healthy.

Keep smiling always.
God bless you.

-- Regards,
तुमच्याच दीपाली मॅडम

I wish you all a very successful and merry life ahead. I wish everyone excels in what they aspire to be. 
I'm sure kuch saalon baad jab milenge toh yeh engineering ke din yaad karke hasenge. 
With this, I Saahil Jawale, CR for IT-A take my leave and once again have a great future ahead ❤️ <This message was edited>
